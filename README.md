# XLSX SPF

This utility is written in Go and features a simple way to loop through a list of domains and return their SPF records. Usecase is typically for sales, to easily get what SPF record domains have.

## Installation

Using Mac?

```shell
brew install cobraz/tools/xlsx-spf
```

**Notes**: The library is not tested on Linux or Windows. There are [executables available](https://github.com/cobraz/xlsx-spf/releases/latest).

## Help

```shell
# Example command
xlsx-spf --input ./domains.xlsx --col 7
```

`--input` is required and should point to your file. `col` is not required, but if you don't have your domain in column number 7, you'll have problems. You can also define where to store your XLSX output, with
the `--output` command.
